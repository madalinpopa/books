# Notes

## Chapter 1

- Responsive designs are made possible with a flexible layout, fluid images, and media queries
- A `meta` tag is needed in the head of your HTML so a browser knows how to render the page
- You'll want all images to be set with a `max-width` of 100% in the CSS by default
- A breakpoint is just a point, typically a screen-width, at which we use a media query to alter the design
- When you write CSS for a responsive design, start with base styles that can work on any device—typically the smallest screen and then use media queries to adapt it for larger screens
- Presently the void tags are `area`, `base`, `br`, `col`, `embed`, `hr`, `img`, `input`, `link`, `meta`, `param`, `source`, `track`, and `wbr`.
- Consider the HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/). It's a premade best practice HTML5 file. You can also custom build the template to match your specific needs.
- The `<section>`element is used to define a generic section of a document or application.
- The `<nav>` element is used to wrap major navigational links to other pages or parts within the same page. 
- The `<article>` element is used to wrap a self-contained piece of content. When structuring a page, ask whether the content you're intending to use within an `<article>` tag could be taken as a whole lump and pasted onto a different site and still make complete sense.
- The `<aside>` element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it. In practical terms, I often use it for sidebars, or content as a little tip about a related subject in a blog post.
- Practically, the `<header>` can be used for the "masthead" area of a site's header but also as an introduction to other content, such as an introduction section within an `<article>` element.
-  Like the `<header>`, it can be used multiple times within a page if needed. For example, it could be used for the footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post `<article>`.
- However, the specification notes that contact information for the author of a blog post should instead be wrapped by an `<address>` element.
- h1–h6 elements must not be used to mark up subheadings, subtitles, alternative titles and taglines unless intended to be the heading for a new section or subsection.
