# Notes

## Chapter 1

- Responsive designs are made possible with a flexible layout, fluid images, and media queries
- A `meta` tag is needed in the head of your HTML so a browser knows how to render the page
- You'll want all images to be set with a `max-width` of 100% in the CSS by default
- A breakpoint is just a point, typically a screen-width, at which we use a media query to alter the design
- When you write CSS for a responsive design, start with base styles that can work on any deviceâ€”typically the smallest screen and then use media queries to adapt it for larger screens
