# The Programmer's Brain by Felienne Hermans

## Chapter 1
- Your LTM stores information you have acquired for a long time, the STM temporarily stores information you have just read or heard, and the working memory processes information and forms new thoughts.
- Lack of Knowledge = Issue in LTM (long time memory)
- Lack of information = Issue in STM (short time memory)
- Lack of processing power = Issue in Working memory
- To resolve confusion you must first identify its source. Confusion while coding is usually caused by three issues: a lack of knowledge, a lack of easy-to-access information, or a lack of processing power in the brain.
- Three cognitive processes are involved when you read or write code: long term memory (LTM), short term memory (STM), and working memory.
- LTM stores knowledge thatmay need to be accessed after a long period of time. For example, the meaning of keywords is stored in LTM.
- STM can temporarily hold information like the name of a method or variable.
- Working memory is where active processing takes place. In code, this may be tasks such as deciding that an index is one too low.
- All three cognitive processes are at work while you’re reading code, and the processes complement each other. For example, if your STM encounters a variable name like n, your brain searches your LTM for related programs you’ve read in the past. And when you read an ambiguous word, your working memory is activated and your brain will try to decide the right meaning in this context.

## Chapter 2
- Research has shown that when code contains comments, programmers will take more time to read its
- The STM has a capacity of two to six elements.
- To overcome the size limitation, your STM collaborates with your LTM when you remember information.
- When you read new information, your brain tries to divide the information into recognizable parts called chunks.
- When you lack enough knowledge in your LTM, you have to rely on low-level reading of code, like letters and keywords. When doing that, you will quickly run out of space in your STM.
- When your LTM stores enough relevant information, you can remember abstract concepts like “a for-loop in Java” or “selection sort in Python” instead of the code at a lower level, occupying less space in your STM.
- When you read code, it is first stored in the iconic memory. Only a bit of the code is subsequently sent to the STM.
- Remembering code can be used as a tool for (self) diagnosis of your knowledge of coding. Because you can most easily remember what you already know, the parts of code that you remember can reveal the design patterns, programming constructs, and domain concepts you are most familiar with.
- Code can contain characteristics that make it easier to process, such as design patterns, comments, and explicit beacons.

## Chapter 3
- It’s important to know quite a bit of syntax by heart because more syntax knowledge will ease chunking. Also, looking up syntax can interrupt your work
- You can use flashcards to practice and remember new syntax, with a prompt on one side and code on the other side.
- You can use flashcards to practice and remember new syntax, with a prompt on one side and code on the other side.
- It’s important to practice new information regularly to fight memory decay.
- The best kind of practice is retrieval practice, where you try to remember information before looking it up.
- To maximize the amount of knowledge you remember, spread your practice over time.
- Information in your LTM is stored as a connected network of related facts.
- Active elaboration of new information helps strengthen the network of memories the new memory will connect to, easing retrieval.

## Chapter 4
- sometimes you might want to refactor code not to make it more maintainable in the long run but more readable for you at that point in time

## Chapter 5
- Writing a summary of code in natural language will help you gain a deeper understanding of whatâ€™s happening in that code.
- A final strategy from text comprehension that we can apply to code comprehension is summarizing what you have just read
- One technique that can be helpful for very complex code of which a deeper understanding is needed is to list all operations in which variables are involved.
- Once you have created the list of identifiers, you can use it to gain a deeper understanding of the code. For example, you can divide the variable names into two different categories: names of variables that are related to the domain of the code, such as Customer or Package, and variable names that are related to programming concepts, such as Tree or Lis
- When reading code, it is important to keep track of what you are reading and whether you understand i
- Siegmundâ€™s findings reliably showed that program comprehension activates five Brodmann areas, all located in the left hemisphere of the brain: BA6, BA21, BA40, BA44, and BA4.
- An fMRI machine can detect which Brodmann areas are active by measuring blood flow in the brain
- To be able to know where to start, you need to understand how the framework links code together
- The focal point of code is an important notion when reading code. Simply put, you have to know where to start reading.
- Plan knowledge, on the other hand, represents understanding what a programmer planned when they created the program or what they were aiming to achieve.
- According to Penningtonâ€™s model, text structure knowledge relates to surface-level understanding of parts of the program, such as knowing what a keyword does or knowing the role of a variable.
