# The Programmer's Brain by Felienne Hermans

## Chapter 1
- Your LTM stores information you have acquired for a long time, the STM temporarily stores information you have just read or heard, and the working memory processes information and forms new thoughts.
- Lack of Knowledge = Issue in LTM (long time memory)
- Lack of information = Issue in STM (short time memory)
- Lack of processing power = Issue in Working memory
- To resolve confusion you must first identify its source. Confusion while coding is usually caused by three issues: a lack of knowledge, a lack of easy-to-access information, or a lack of processing power in the brain.
- Three cognitive processes are involved when you read or write code: long term memory (LTM), short term memory (STM), and working memory.
- LTM stores knowledge thatmay need to be accessed after a long period of time. For example, the meaning of keywords is stored in LTM.
- STM can temporarily hold information like the name of a method or variable.
- Working memory is where active processing takes place. In code, this may be tasks such as deciding that an index is one too low.
- All three cognitive processes are at work while you’re reading code, and the processes complement each other. For example, if your STM encounters a variable name like n, your brain searches your LTM for related programs you’ve read in the past. And when you read an ambiguous word, your working memory is activated and your brain will try to decide the right meaning in this context.

## Chapter 2
- Research has shown that when code contains comments, programmers will take more time to read its
- The STM has a capacity of two to six elements.
- To overcome the size limitation, your STM collaborates with your LTM when you remember information.
- When you read new information, your brain tries to divide the information into recognizable parts called chunks.
- When you lack enough knowledge in your LTM, you have to rely on low-level reading of code, like letters and keywords. When doing that, you will quickly run out of space in your STM.
- When your LTM stores enough relevant information, you can remember abstract concepts like “a for-loop in Java” or “selection sort in Python” instead of the code at a lower level, occupying less space in your STM.
- When you read code, it is first stored in the iconic memory. Only a bit of the code is subsequently sent to the STM.
- Remembering code can be used as a tool for (self) diagnosis of your knowledge of coding. Because you can most easily remember what you already know, the parts of code that you remember can reveal the design patterns, programming constructs, and domain concepts you are most familiar with.
- Code can contain characteristics that make it easier to process, such as design patterns, comments, and explicit beacons.

## Chapter 3
- It’s important to know quite a bit of syntax by heart because more syntax knowledge will ease chunking. Also, looking up syntax can interrupt your work
- You can use flashcards to practice and remember new syntax, with a prompt on one side and code on the other side.
- You can use flashcards to practice and remember new syntax, with a prompt on one side and code on the other side.
- It’s important to practice new information regularly to fight memory decay.
- The best kind of practice is retrieval practice, where you try to remember information before looking it up.
- To maximize the amount of knowledge you remember, spread your practice over time.
- Information in your LTM is stored as a connected network of related facts.
- Active elaboration of new information helps strengthen the network of memories the new memory will connect to, easing retrieval.
