## Signals

- Signals are one of the oldest methods of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and are used to notify processes about asynchronous events (or exceptions).
- Signals canonly be sent between processes owned by the same user or from a process owned by the superuser to any process.
- To see a list of the signals in Linux, along with their numbers, do kill -l
- When a process receives a signal, what it does will depend on the way the program is written. It can take specific actions, coded into the program, to handle the signal or it can just respond according to system defaults.
- Since a process cannot send a signal directly to another process, it must ask the kernel to send the signal
- Users (including the superuser) can send signals to other processes (programs) by using kill.

# RPM

- All rpm inquiries include the -q option, which can be combined with numerous other query options:
- -f: allows you to determine which package a file came from
- -l: lists the contents of a specific package
- -a: all the packages installed on the system
- -i: information about the package
- -p: run the query against a package file instead of the package database
- The -V option to rpm allows you to verify whether the files from a particular package are consistent with the systemâ€™s RPM database
- RPM performs dependency checks. This is necessary because some packages will not operate properly unless some other package is also installed.
- RPM performs conflict checks, including attempts to install an already-installed package or to install an older version over a newer version.
- The developer building a package can specify that certain tasks be performed before or after the install.
- RPM performs any post-install tasks required for setup or initialization.
- Every time RPM installs a package, it updates information in the system database. It uses this information when checking for conflicts.
- The -i option is not designed for upgrades; attempting to install a new RPM package over an older one fails with error messages, because it tries to overwrite existing system files.
- If you want to downgrade with rpm -U (that is, to replace the current version with an earlier version), you must add the --oldpackage option to the command line.
- rpm2archive is used to convert RPM package files to tar archives. If - is given as an argument, input and output will be on stdin and stdout.
